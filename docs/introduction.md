# Brief Introduction

*This is an introductory overview (Part One) in a series of articles covering developments in the decentralized identity space powered by Web3*.       
       
First, let’s take a quick detour into what these articles are not about, which is the timeless debate on “stewardship” of our data by major tech players (FAANG).  The fact that we even have to mention it here speaks to its ubiquity, so our story will bypass some of the constant rhetoric typical of that debate, and simply treat it as an unresolved given.       
        
It’s easy to be the unquestioning evangelist in presenting ‘the other side’ - the decentralized, autonomous provision of our online selves within the emerging context of DAO’s, Dapp’s, DEX’s, social graphs, and tokenomics, as well as the growing ecosystem of increasingly decentralized infrastructure we know as Web3.          
            
What I hope to do here in this series (in addition of playing advocate and sometimes critic of the latest Web3 developments in this already complex space) is highlight some the major issues, concepts, developer frameworks and existing infrastructure working together towards a fully self-sovereign future for our identity data. I also aim to present the current and future challenges on standards adoption, usability, and governance - that for the moment - hinder our progress in ensuring a widespread rollout of a unified, common decentralized identity framework.
